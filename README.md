# RGB-Time-Fountain-V2

The RGB Time Fountain is water fountain that utilises the stroboscopic effect to create illusions of the water drops floating or even flowing upwards. Using precisely timed and synchronised red, green and blue strobe lights allows many beautiful and mesmerising illusions to be created.
